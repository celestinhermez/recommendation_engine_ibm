# Recommendation Engine for IBM Watson
This project was originally part of Udacity's Data Scientist 
nanodegree. The development notebook included in this repository 
contained the basic steps to create the methods that inform
the Recommender class I created. 

The goal of this module is to simplify the creation of a simple
recommender system for articles. Anyone with two csv files containing
information about the interactions between users and existing articles
as well as a description about these articles is able to create
a recommendation engine with a few lines of code thanks to this project.


Certain article names weird because of formatting in original doc, normal
Specify developed on Mac.
